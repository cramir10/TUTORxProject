 Peer to Peer Tutoring
Tutoring site for UNCC students where they can register as tutors or students. Tutors can sign up to tutor students in classes they've taken and excelled in and students can sign up to be tutored in classes they need help with. This site makes it easier to set up times for tutoring that is more convenient for both parties than what is allowed through tutoring on the UNCC site. TUTORx includes all courses available at UNCC and can be updated for each semester whether new courses are added or old courses are removed.
